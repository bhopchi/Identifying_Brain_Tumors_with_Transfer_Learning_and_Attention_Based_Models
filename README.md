# Identifying_Brain_Tumors_with_Transfer_Learning_and_Attention_Based_Models
This project utilizes pretrained CNNs with attention mechanisms for brain tumor classification, identifying glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumor cases. It applies label encoding, oversampling for balance, and evaluates model performance through metrics, achieving high accuracy in tumor detection.
